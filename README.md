# Cross Platform 3D Graphics Engine

*This project is preserved mostly as an old archive of my past work*

**Project Date**
: 2007

**Status**
: Archive *(incomplete)*

**Technologies**
: C++, OpenGL

This was my attempt to create a cross platform 3D graphics engine. A few graphics primatives were created, text mapped fonts, PNG loading, and some OOP encapsulation of OpenGL calls was accomplished. This project was never finished.
