# Cross Platform 3D Graphics Engine

*This project is preserved mostly as an old archive of my past work*

**Project Date**
: 2007

**Status**
: Archive *(incomplete)*

**Technologies**
: C++, OpenGL

This project was started to create a cross platform 3D graphics engine. I managed to build a library of graphics primatives, implement texture mapped fonts, PNG loading, and encapsulate some of the OpenGL calls in RAII objects. This project remains incomplete.
